# Stock-Market-Analysis
Built an awesome interactive tableau stock market dashboard. Used Pandas to manipulate our data and created new columns like the moving average 50 and moving average 200, percent change in price, and percent change in volume which are used for comparison to get the csv files that we will use to create the dashboard.
